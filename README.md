All of my robotics-related project are hosted on the [Baxterminator](https://github.com/Baxterminator) organisation. Here are some core projects of mine:
- [ecn_baxter](https://github.com/Baxterminator/ecn_baxter) A ROS1/ROS2 package that provide a "game" environnement to ECN Labs
- [robot_analysis](https://github.com/Baxterminator/robot_analysis) A python package implementing display utilities and lacking math methods
